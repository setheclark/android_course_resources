## Tip Calculator

Code a Tip Calculator Application. You application should have the ability for the user to enter the amount of their bill and select from a few of the more common tip percentage amounts (10%, 15%, 18%, 20%, ...). The application should choose a default tip percentage so that the only required input from the user is the bill amount.

A simple approach would be to have the user click a button for the application to calculate the tip amount. Another option would be to have the application calculating the tip amount as the user enters their bill amount.

The tip amount should be displayed on the screen for the user.

Requirements:
- Your application must make use of a `ViewModel` and `LiveData` to keep the `Activity` free of any non-view related code.

When complete, zip up the project folder and submit it to Titus.
